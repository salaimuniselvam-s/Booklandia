"Freedom from the Known" is a book by Jiddu Krishnamurti, a philosopher, and spiritual teacher. In this book, Krishnamurti emphasizes the need for individuals to break free from the constraints of their conditioning and the limitations of their beliefs in order to discover true freedom and live a more fulfilling life.

Krishnamurti argues that our minds are conditioned by various factors such as culture, religion, education, and society, and that this conditioning prevents us from seeing things as they really are. He suggests that we must become aware of this conditioning and question everything we have been taught in order to break free from it.

Krishnamurti also emphasizes the importance of living in the present moment and letting go of the past and the future. He believes that by being fully present and aware, we can experience true freedom and live a more authentic life.

Overall, "Freedom from the Known" is a call to action for individuals to break free from their mental limitations and live a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

"Tradition becomes our security, and when the mind is secure it is in decay."

"To be free of all authority, of your own and that of another, is to die to everything of yesterday, so that your mind is always fresh, always young, innocent, full of vigor and passion."

"Freedom is not something to be achieved. Freedom is the absence of all bondage."

"It is only when the mind is free from the old that it meets everything anew, and in that there is joy."

"Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect." 

"The observer is the observed."

"The moment you follow someone you cease to follow Truth." 

"To understand the immeasurable, the mind must be extraordinarily quiet, still." 

Krishnamurti also uses the analogy of a river to describe the nature of the mind. He suggests that our thoughts and emotions are like the surface of a river, constantly changing and flowing. However, beneath the surface, there is a deep stillness and tranquility that we can tap into through meditation and self-awareness.

Time is the interval between idea and action.
