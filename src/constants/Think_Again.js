  Analogies: [
    "Architect and Gardener: Grant compares two different mindsets—architect and gardener—to illustrate different approaches to thinking and planning. The architect mindset represents meticulous planning and sticking to a fixed blueprint, while the gardener mindset embodies adaptability, nurturing, and allowing for organic growth. This analogy encourages readers to embrace the flexibility of the gardener mindset in their thinking.",

    "Intellectual Sumo: Grant uses the analogy of intellectual sumo to describe the practice of seeking out opposing viewpoints and engaging in productive debates. Just as sumo wrestlers aim to challenge and push each other, engaging with opposing ideas allows individuals to refine their own thinking and strengthen their arguments.",

    "Unlearning as Emptying the Cup: The analogy of emptying a cup represents the process of unlearning. Grant suggests that unlearning requires individuals to let go of preconceived notions and be open to new perspectives. Just as an empty cup can be filled with fresh knowledge, unlearning involves making space for new ideas and challenging old assumptions.",

    "Rethinking as a Polaroid Picture: Grant compares the process of rethinking to a Polaroid picture that gradually develops. Initially, ideas may be hazy or incomplete, but through continued reflection and exploration, a clearer understanding emerges. This analogy highlights the iterative nature of rethinking and encourages readers to embrace the evolving nature of their thoughts.",

    "Intellectual Humility as a Trampoline: Grant likens intellectual humility to a trampoline. Just as a trampoline provides a springboard for jumping higher, intellectual humility enables individuals to bounce back from failures and setbacks, learn from others, and reach new heights in their thinking.",

    "Rethinking as Mental Maps: Grant compares the process of rethinking to updating mental maps. Just as physical maps need to be revised as new roads are built or landmarks change, our mental maps of the world should be continuously updated to accommodate new information and insights.",

    "Argument as a Gyroscope: Grant uses the analogy of a gyroscope to describe arguments that help individuals stay balanced in their thinking. Just as a gyroscope maintains stability by counteracting external forces, engaging in well-constructed arguments can help individuals find balance and avoid being swayed by biases or misinformation.",

    "Mental Mold as a Sculptor: Grant likens the influence of our environment and experiences on our thinking to a sculptor shaping clay. Just as a sculptor molds clay into a specific form, our mental mold, shaped by our upbringing, education, and experiences, influences our beliefs and perspectives. The analogy highlights the need to consciously reshape our mental mold to foster growth and open-mindedness.",

    "Rethinking as an Icebreaker: Grant compares rethinking to an icebreaker ship that navigates through frozen waters. Just as an icebreaker clears a path and breaks through obstacles, rethinking enables individuals to overcome mental barriers, challenge assumptions, and forge new perspectives.",

  quotes: [
    "If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom.",
    "We listen to views that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard.",
    "We favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt",
    "Research reveals that the higher you score on an IQ test, the more likely you are to fall for stereotypes, because you’re faster at recognizing patterns. And recent experiments suggest that the smarter you are, the more you might struggle to update your beliefs.",
    "A mark of lifelong learners is recognizing that they can learn something from everyone they meet.",
    "Thinking like a scientist involves more than just reacting with an open mind. It means being actively open-minded. It requires searching for reasons why we might be wrong—not for reasons why we must be right—and revising our views based on what we learn.",
    "We learn more from people who challenge our thought process than those who affirm our conclusions. Strong leaders engage their critics and make themselves stronger. Weak leaders silence their critics and make themselves weaker. This reaction isn’t limited to people in power. Although we might be on board with the principle, in practice we often miss out on the value of a challenge network.",
    "How do you know? It’s a question we need to ask more often, both of ourselves and of others. The power lies in its frankness. It’s nonjudgmental—a straightforward expression of doubt and curiosity that doesn’t put people on the defensive.",
    "Part of the problem is cognitive laziness. Some psychologists point out that we’re mental misers: we often prefer the ease of hanging on to old views over the difficulty of grappling with new ones. Yet there are also deeper forces behind our resistance to rethinking. Questioning ourselves makes the world more unpredictable. It requires us to admit that the facts may have changed, that what was once right may now be wrong. Reconsidering something we believe deeply can threaten our identities, making it feel as if we’re losing a part of ourselves.",
    "The less intelligent we are in a particular domain, the more we seem to overestimate our actual intelligence in that domain",
    "It’s a sign of wisdom to avoid believing every thought that enters your mind. It’s a mark of emotional intelligence to avoid internalizing every feeling that enters your heart.",
    "Intelligence is traditionally viewed as the ability to think and learn. Yet in a turbulent world, there’s another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn.",
    "We laugh at people who still use Windows 95, yet we still cling to opinions that we formed in 1995.",
    "We all have blind spots in our knowledge and opinions. The bad news is that they can leave us blind to our blindness, which gives us false confidence in our judgment and prevents us from rethinking. The good news is that with the right kind of confidence, we can learn to see ourselves more clearly and update our views. In driver’s training we were taught to identify our visual blind spots and eliminate them with the help of mirrors and sensors. In life, since our minds don’t come equipped with those tools, we need to learn to recognize our cognitive blind spots and revise our thinking accordingly.",
    "After all, the purpose of learning isn’t to affirm our beliefs; it’s to evolve our beliefs.",
    "Progress is impossible without change; and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything. —George Bernard Shaw",
    "people often become attached to best practices. The risk is that once we’ve declared a routine the best, it becomes frozen in time.",
    "When you’re wrong, it’s not something to be depressed about. Say, ‘Hey, I discovered something!",
    "those who can’t . . . don’t know they can’t. According to what’s now known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, it’s when we lack competence that we’re most likely to be brimming with overconfidence.",
    "confirmation bias: seeing what we expect to see. The other is desirability bias: seeing what we want to see.",
    "Who you are should be a question of what you value, not what you believe. Values are your core principles in life—they might be excellence and generosity, freedom and fairness, or security and integrity",
