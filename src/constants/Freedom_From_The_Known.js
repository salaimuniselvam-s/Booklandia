  description: [
    "Krishnamurti argues that our minds are conditioned by various factors such as culture, religion, education, and society, and that this conditioning prevents us from seeing things as they really are. He suggests that we must become aware of this conditioning and question everything we have been taught in order to break free from it",
    "Krishnamurti also emphasizes the importance of living in the present moment and letting go of the past and the future. He believes that by being fully present and aware, we can experience true freedom and live a more authentic life. ",
    "Overall, Freedom from the Known is a call to action for individuals to break free from their mental limitations and live a more fulfilling and meaningful life.",

  quotes: [
    "Tradition becomes our security, and when the mind is secure it is in decay.",

    "Krishnamurti also uses the analogy of a river to describe the nature of the mind. He suggests that our thoughts and emotions are like the surface of a river, constantly changing and flowing.

    "The river: Krishnamurti also uses the analogy of a river to describe the nature of the mind.

However, beneath the surface, there is a deep stillness and tranquility that we can tap into through meditation and self-awareness.",

    "The cage: Krishnamurti argues that many people live their lives in a cage of their own making, limited by their beliefs, fears, and prejudices. He suggests that we must break free from this cage and experience life directly and without preconceptions.",

    "The map and the territory: Krishnamurti suggests that our beliefs and concepts about reality are like a map that we use to navigate through life.

    "The observer and the observed: Krishnamurti suggests that the observer (our sense of self) and the observed (the world around us) are not separate, but rather part of a single, undivided whole. He argues that we must transcend our sense of self and experience the world directly, without the filter of our ego.",
