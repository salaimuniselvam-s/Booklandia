  quotes: [

    "Only things that are imperfect, incomplete, and ephemeral can truly be beautiful, because only those things resemble the natural world.",
    "Just as worry often brings about precisely the thing that was feared, excessive attention to a desire (or “hyper-intention”) can keep that desire from being fulfilled.",
    "When you have a clear purpose, no one can stop you.",
    "Life is pure imperfection, as the philosophy of wabi-sabi teaches us, and the passage of time shows us that everything is fleeting, but if you have a clear sense of your ikigai, each moment will hold so many possibilities that it will seem almost like an eternity.",

  Analogies: [
    "A Venn Diagram: The authors use a Venn diagram to illustrate the convergence of the four elements of ikigai: what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. The overlapping area represents ikigai, where all four elements come together.",

    "A Bow and Arrow: The book compares finding one's ikigai to the process of pulling back a bow and arrow. Just as pulling back requires effort and tension, the authors suggest that discovering one's ikigai involves self-reflection, introspection, and sometimes facing discomfort or challenges. Releasing the arrow represents living in alignment with one's ikigai and experiencing a sense of purpose.",

    "Gardening: The authors draw parallels between tending to a garden and nurturing one's ikigai. They describe how, like a garden, ikigai requires regular care, attention, and cultivation. Just as a garden flourishes when tended to with love and effort, living in accordance with one's ikigai leads to growth, fulfillment, and a flourishing life.",

    "A Map and a Journey: The book likens the search for ikigai to embarking on a journey with a map. The map represents self-reflection and exploration, while the journey represents the process of living in alignment with one's purpose. Like any journey, it may have twists, turns, and detours, but ultimately, it is about navigating towards one's ikigai and finding fulfillment along the way.",

    "A River: The authors use the analogy of a river to describe the flow of life and finding ikigai.
