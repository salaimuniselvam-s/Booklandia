  summary:
    "Lateral thinking is a problem-solving approach that involves thinking creatively and considering unconventional or non-linear perspectives to find innovative solutions. It was introduced by Edward de Bono, a psychologist and author, and is often contrasted with vertical thinking, which focuses on logical and sequential reasoning. Overall, lateral thinking encourages individuals to break free from conventional patterns of thinking and explore new possibilities. By adopting a creative and unconventional mindset, lateral thinking can be a powerful tool for solving complex problems and generating innovative ideas.",
