The second step is to try and understand the biases of those we disagree with.","Technology is never deterministic.

In politics, this meant replacing the chaotic rule of kings and emperors with more orderly systems such as republics and democracies.","The quality of our questions determines the quality of our answers.","The notion of 'free will' doesn't mean that I can do whatever I want. It means I can choose between options and reflect on those choices.","We are all members of the same flawed species, and nobody is above human error.","Inequality is not the same as unfairness.

By understanding and optimizing each stage of the habit loop, you can effectively create and reinforce new habits.","Habit Stacking: Linking a new habit with an existing one by using a specific cue can help in forming new habits. This strategy leverages the existing habits as a trigger for the new ones.","Environment Design: Modifying your environment to make desired behaviors more convenient and undesirable behaviors more difficult can greatly influence habit formation. Small changes in your surroundings can have a significant impact on your habits.","The Two-Minute Rule: Breaking down habits into small, manageable tasks that can be done in two minutes or less increases the likelihood of starting and maintaining those habits. This helps overcome procrastination and builds momentum.","Habit Tracking: Keeping track of your habits and progress provides a visual representation of your efforts and motivates you to stay consistent. Various methods, such as habit tracking apps or journals, can be used to monitor your habits.","Identity-Based Habits: Shifting your focus from achieving specific outcomes to adopting a new identity can lead to more lasting behavior change.

By aligning your habits with your desired identity, behavior change becomes more natural and sustainable.","The Two-Minute Rule: Clear uses the analogy of a two-minute task to illustrate the concept of starting small. He suggests that if a habit takes less than two minutes to do, it becomes much easier to overcome resistance and take action. This analogy highlights the power of breaking habits down into manageable, bite-sized tasks.","The Plateau of Latent Potential: Clear compares habit formation to the melting of an ice cube again, but this time he introduces the concept of a plateau of latent potential. Just as an ice cube remains seemingly unchanged until it reaches the melting point, habits often show no visible progress until a critical mass is reached. This analogy emphasizes the importance of persistence and patience in habit formation.","The Fallacy of Achievement: Clear uses the analogy of reaching the summit of a mountain to caution against the 'arrival fallacy.'

He highlights that just as farmers need to consistently tend to their crops, providing water, nutrients, and protection, individuals need to consistently invest in their personal development by taking small, daily actions. Over time, these actions will yield a bountiful harvest of success.","The Frog in Boiling Water Analogy: Hardy uses the analogy of a frog in boiling water to illustrate the danger of complacency and gradual negative changes. Just as a frog placed in boiling water will jump out immediately, but if placed in cool water that gradually heats up, it will not perceive the danger until it's too late. The analogy emphasizes the importance of being aware of small negative habits or situations that can slowly erode progress and success.","The GPS Analogy: Hardy compares the compound effect to a GPS system. Just as a GPS calculates the best route by constantly recalculating based on every turn and decision, the compound effect helps individuals adjust their actions and choices along the way to stay on track toward their goals.","The Butterfly Effect Analogy: Hardy references the butterfly effect, which states that small causes can have large effects.

Who was responsible? Neither kings, nor priests, nor merchants. The culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice, and potatoes.","The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes.","Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees, and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations, and corporations.","The ability to speak about fictions is the most unique feature of Sapiens language.","Money is accordingly a system of mutual trust, and not just any system of mutual trust: money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.","The truly unique trait of Sapiens is our ability to create and believe fiction. All other animals use their communication system to describe reality. We use our communication system to create new realities.","To change an existing imagined order, we must first believe in an alternative imagined order.","One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations.","Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural.","We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine.","Fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively.","Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths.","Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural.","Homo sapiens is just not built for satisfaction. Human happiness depends less on objective conditions and more on our own expectations.","A good rule of thumb is 'Biology enables, Culture forbids.'","You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.","People easily understand that 'primitives' cement their social order by believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our modern institutions function on exactly the same basis.","The story of the agricultural revolution is the story of how Homo sapiens domesticated the plants and animals around us, and how these new life-forms transformed us.","Evolution has made Homo sapiens, like other social mammals, a xenophobic creature. Sapiens instinctively divide humanity into two parts, 'we' and 'they'.","We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us.","Sapiens acquired the ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers because we can create and believe fiction.","Scientists estimate that a mere 150,000 years ago, there were at least six different human species on Earth. Today, Homo sapiens is the only one left.","In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power.","The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites.","The cognitive revolution is accordingly the point when history declared its independence from biology."],Analogies:["The Tree of Knowledge: Harari likens the cognitive revolution to humans climbing a tree of knowledge. Just as climbing a tree provides a broader view of the surroundings, the development of language and knowledge allowed early humans to gain a new perspective and navigate the world more effectively.","The Agricultural Trap: Harari compares the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture to a trap. While agriculture brought stability and surplus food production, it also led to population growth, labor-intensive farming practices, and increased social complexities. Harari argues that humans unintentionally fell into this trap, forever changing their way of life.",'Imagined Orders: Harari introduces the concept of "imagined orders" to describe the collective beliefs and societal structures that humans create. He likens imagined orders, such as religions, nations, and money, to fictional stories that shape human behavior and allow large-scale cooperation beyond immediate personal relationships.',"The Dataist Revolution: Harari introduces the concept of a potential future revolution where data and algorithms govern human society. He draws an analogy to the humanist revolution, which placed humans at the center of the universe, and proposes that the emerging dominance of data and algorithms could shift the focus away from human decision-making and control.","The Fountain of Culture: Harari describes culture as a fountain that continuously generates new ideas, beliefs, and practices. Just as a fountain sprouts new water droplets, culture perpetually produces fresh concepts and customs that shape human society.","The Credit System: Harari likens the concept of money and credit to a shared fiction that enables trust and facilitates economic transactions. He explains that money is valuable because people believe it has value, similar to how a piece of paper holds worth due to the collective agreement that it represents something of value.","The Dance of Genes and Culture: Harari uses the metaphor of a dance to describe the complex interplay between genetic evolution and cultural evolution. Genes provide the biological framework, while culture guides and shapes human behavior and society, much like dancers moving in harmony with a predefined choreography.","The Historical Game: Harari compares history to a game where the rules constantly change. Just as players adapt their strategies based on the evolving rules, societies and individuals must navigate and adjust to the changing dynamics and circumstances of history to thrive and survive.","The Social Organism: Harari likens human societies to complex organisms. Just as individual cells work together to form a cohesive organism, humans cooperate and coordinate their actions to create functioning societies with interconnected systems and structures.","The Web of Interdependence: Harari describes the intricate web of interdependence among humans, animals, and plants. He compares this web to an ecosystem, where each component relies on others for survival and well-being. Humans depend on agriculture, which depends on fertile soil, which depends on certain climatic conditions, creating a delicate balance of interdependence.","The Matrix of Power: Harari uses the analogy of a matrix to depict the intricate network of power dynamics within societies. He argues that power is not centralized in a single entity but rather distributed among various institutions and individuals, forming a complex web of influence and control.","The Historical Sailing Ship: Harari uses the analogy of a historical sailing ship to describe how cultural and technological changes propel human societies forward. Just as a ship requires the combination of wind, sails, and navigational skills to move forward, human societies progress through a combination of cultural developments, technological advancements, and societal adaptations."]},Uv={title:"Siddhartha",author:"Hermann Hesse",authorUrl:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hesse",summary:'"Siddhartha" is a novel that follows the spiritual journey of a young Indian man named Siddhartha.

It’s a mark of emotional intelligence to avoid internalizing every feeling that enters your heart.","Intelligence is traditionally viewed as the ability to think and learn. Yet in a turbulent world, there’s another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn.","We laugh at people who still use Windows 95, yet we still cling to opinions that we formed in 1995.","We all have blind spots in our knowledge and opinions. The bad news is that they can leave us blind to our blindness, which gives us false confidence in our judgment and prevents us from rethinking. The good news is that with the right kind of confidence, we can learn to see ourselves more clearly and update our views. In driver’s training we were taught to identify our visual blind spots and eliminate them with the help of mirrors and sensors. In life, since our minds don’t come equipped with those tools, we need to learn to recognize our cognitive blind spots and revise our thinking accordingly.","After all, the purpose of learning isn’t to affirm our beliefs; it’s to evolve our beliefs.","Progress is impossible without change; and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything. —George Bernard Shaw","people often become attached to best practices.

He encourages readers to step back and observe the rooms without getting caught up in their contents.","Thorns and Roses: Singer uses the analogy of thorns and roses to illustrate that in life, we encounter both pleasant and unpleasant experiences. He suggests that instead of resisting the thorns (difficulties), we should focus on appreciating the roses (positive moments) and not allow the thorns to overshadow the beauty.","Inner Energy: Singer likens the flow of energy within us to a fountain. He explains that by keeping the fountain of energy open and unobstructed, we can experience a continuous state of vitality, joy, and inspiration.","Prickles of Pain: Singer describes the accumulation of unresolved emotions as prickles of pain that stick to our hearts. He encourages readers to face and release these emotions, comparing it to removing the prickles one by one, leading to a greater sense of inner freedom.","The Inner Seat: Singer uses the analogy of an inner seat or throne to represent the place of conscious awareness within us.

He suggests that by continuously cleaning the glass through self-awareness and letting go, we can experience the true brilliance of our inner being.","Tug of War: Singer uses the analogy of a tug of war between our true self and the ego. He explains that when we resist or engage with our thoughts and emotions, we are giving power to the ego, resulting in inner conflict. By letting go and allowing thoughts and emotions to pass through us without attachment, we can weaken the grip of the ego and experience inner peace.","Bus Ride: Singer likens life's experiences to being on a bus. He suggests that we can either be fully engaged in the bus ride, getting caught up in every twist and turn, or we can choose to be the passenger who observes the ride with detachment and calmness. This analogy encourages readers to adopt a perspective of witnessing rather than full identification with life's ups and downs.","Onion Layers: Singer compares the process of self-discovery to peeling layers of an onion. He suggests that as we delve deeper into our consciousness, we uncover deeper layers of conditioning, beliefs, and attachments. By peeling away these layers, we can get closer to our true essence and experience liberation.","Orchestra Conductor: Singer uses the analogy of an orchestra conductor to describe the role of the inner observer. He suggests that just as a conductor guides and orchestrates the various instruments, we can learn to direct our thoughts, emotions, and actions from a place of centered awareness."]},ni=[Av,Kv,wv,Hv,Yv,Sv,Vv,Wv,Rv,Fv,Ev,$v,vv,Mv,Bv,qv,_v,Nv,Jv,Gv,zv,jv,Ov,bv,xv,kv,Pv,Lv,Cv,Iv,Tv,Uv,Dv],Bc=e=>{const t=e.indexOf(":"),n=e.substring(0,t),i=e.substring(t+1);return R.jsxs("span",{children:[n.length>0?R.jsxs("span",{className:"font-size-16 font-semibold",children:[n,":"]}):"",R.jsx("span",{children:i})]})},Qv=e=>{const t=w.useRef(null),[n,i]=w.useState(!1),o=s=>{const[l]=s;l.isIntersecting&&i(!0)},a=s=>{const[l]=s;i(l.isIntersecting)},r=e.reappear?a:o;return w.useEffect(()=>{const s=t.current,l=new IntersectionObserver(r,e);return s&&l.observe(s),()=>{s&&l.unobserve(s)}},[t,e,r]),[t,n]},Vc=({children:e,reappear:t=!1,threshold:n=.1,fromRight:i})=>{const[o,a]=Qv({threshold:n,reappear:t});return R.jsx(R.Fragment,{children:R.jsx("div",{ref:o,className:`transition duration-700 ${a?"opacity-100 blur-none translate-x-0":`opacity-0 blur-lg ${i?"translate-x-20":"-translate-x-20"}`} motion-reduce:transition-none motion-reduce:hover:transform-none`,children:e})})},Xv=()=>{const{bookName:e}=Yy();return w.useEffect(()=>{window.scrollTo(0,0)},[]),R.jsx("div",{className:"max-w-7xl mx-auto",children:ni.filter(t=>t.title===e).map((t,n)=>R.jsxs("div",{className:"flex flex-col items-center  justify-center m-3",children:[R.jsxs("div",{className:"text-3xl text-center font-semibold",children:[t.title," ",R.jsx("br",{}),R.jsxs("div",{className:"text-base text-center italic",children:["by ",R.jsx("br",{})," ",R.jsx("span",{className:"cursor-pointer",onClick:()=>window.open(t.authorUrl),children:t.author})]})]}),R.jsx("div",{className:"p-3 font-medium",children:t.summary}),R.jsx("div",{className:"p-3 font-normal",children:R.jsx("ul",{className:"list-disc list-inside",children:t.description.map((i,o)=>R.jsx("li",{className:"p-1",children:Bc(i)},o))})}),R.jsx(Vc,{children:R.jsxs("div",{className:"p-3 mt-3 mb-9 bg-slate-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow",children:[R.jsxs("div",{className:"text-2xl p-1 font-semibold text-center",children:[R.jsx("i",{className:"fa-solid fa-thought-bubble"})," Analogies"]}),R.jsx("div",{children:t.Analogies.map((i,o)=>R.jsx("p",{className:"p-3 my-3 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow hover:bg-gray-100",children:Bc(i)},o))})]})}),R.jsx(Vc,{fromRight:!0,children:R.jsxs("div",{className:"p-3 mb-6 bg-slate-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow",children:[R.jsxs("div",{className:"text-2xl p-1 font-semibold text-center",children:[R.jsx("i",{className:"fa-sharp fa-solid fa-book-open-reader mr-2"}),"Quotes"]}),R.jsx("div",{children:t.quotes.map((i,o)=>R.jsx("p",{className:"p-3 my-3 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow hover:bg-gray-100 ",children:`"${i}"`},o))})]})})]},n))})};var Bf={exports:{}},Zv="SECRET_DO_NOT_PASS_THIS_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED",ew=Zv,tw=ew;function Vf(){}function Wf(){}Wf.resetWarningCache=Vf;var nw=function(){function e(i,o,a,r,s,l){if(l!==tw){var u=new Error("Calling PropTypes validators directly is not supported by the `prop-types` package.
