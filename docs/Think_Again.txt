-----------------------------------

Architect and Gardener: Grant compares two different mindsets—architect and gardener—to illustrate different approaches to thinking and planning. The architect mindset represents meticulous planning and sticking to a fixed blueprint, while the gardener mindset embodies adaptability, nurturing, and allowing for organic growth. This analogy encourages readers to embrace the flexibility of the gardener mindset in their thinking.

Intellectual Sumo: Grant uses the analogy of intellectual sumo to describe the practice of seeking out opposing viewpoints and engaging in productive debates. Just as sumo wrestlers aim to challenge and push each other, engaging with opposing ideas allows individuals to refine their own thinking and strengthen their arguments.

Unlearning as Emptying the Cup: The analogy of emptying a cup represents the process of unlearning. Grant suggests that unlearning requires individuals to let go of preconceived notions and be open to new perspectives. Just as an empty cup can be filled with fresh knowledge, unlearning involves making space for new ideas and challenging old assumptions.

Rethinking as a Polaroid Picture: Grant compares the process of rethinking to a Polaroid picture that gradually develops. Initially, ideas may be hazy or incomplete, but through continued reflection and exploration, a clearer understanding emerges. This analogy highlights the iterative nature of rethinking and encourages readers to embrace the evolving nature of their thoughts.

Intellectual Humility as a Trampoline: Grant likens intellectual humility to a trampoline. Just as a trampoline provides a springboard for jumping higher, intellectual humility enables individuals to bounce back from failures and setbacks, learn from others, and reach new heights in their thinking.

Rethinking as Mental Maps: Grant compares the process of rethinking to updating mental maps. Just as physical maps need to be revised as new roads are built or landmarks change, our mental maps of the world should be continuously updated to accommodate new information and insights.

Argument as a Gyroscope: Grant uses the analogy of a gyroscope to describe arguments that help individuals stay balanced in their thinking. Just as a gyroscope maintains stability by counteracting external forces, engaging in well-constructed arguments can help individuals find balance and avoid being swayed by biases or misinformation.

Mental Mold as a Sculptor: Grant likens the influence of our environment and experiences on our thinking to a sculptor shaping clay. Just as a sculptor molds clay into a specific form, our mental mold, shaped by our upbringing, education, and experiences, influences our beliefs and perspectives. The analogy highlights the need to consciously reshape our mental mold to foster growth and open-mindedness.

Rethinking as an Icebreaker: Grant compares rethinking to an icebreaker ship that navigates through frozen waters. Just as an icebreaker clears a path and breaks through obstacles, rethinking enables individuals to overcome mental barriers, challenge assumptions, and forge new perspectives.
